   again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; 
you can only connect them looking backward. 
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. 
You have to trust in something¡ª¡ªyour gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. 
Because believing the dots would connect down the road, 
would give you the confidence to follow your heart, 
even when it leads you off the well-worn path, 
and that would make all the difference.
